    for several DRAM protocols such as DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR3, LPDDR4, GDDR5,
    GDDR6, HBM, HMC, STT-MRAM. It is implemented in C++ as an objected
    oriented model that includes a parameterized DRAM bank model, DRAM
    controllers, command queues and system-level interfaces to interact with
    a CPU simulator (GEM5, ZSim) or trace workloads. It is designed to be
    accurate, portable and parallel."""
